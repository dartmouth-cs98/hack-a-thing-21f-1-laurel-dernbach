# Intro to [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) Part 2

## What you built? 

To begin working with Flutter, I followed Google's tutorial for downloading the SDK and building
an app that creates an infinite list of potential startup names, based on random pairings of words
from the English language. The main code is in lib/main.dart.
Below is a screenshot of the app on a virtual Android Machine:

## Who Did What?

I followed this tutorial on my own.

## What you learned

### What worked

* Since I already had everything installed, I enjoyed this hacktivity a lot more because I got to spend more time coding
* Like any coding language, practice makes perfect. Second time around, I already felt much more comfortable working in Dart
* I actually tested cross platform this time! (Android and Web) It is impressive the way the apps mimic the native platform's "vibe" (for lack of a better word)

### What didn't work

* I don't really like the way Flutter organizes its theme/design hierarchy--the way code takes precedence is strange and not intuitive
  (I assume this is the cost of app looking "natural" cross platform)
