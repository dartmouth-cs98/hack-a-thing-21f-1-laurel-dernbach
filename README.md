# Intro to [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)

## What you built? 

To begin working with Flutter, I followed Google's tutorial for downloading the SDK and building
an app that creates an infinite list of potential startup names, based on random pairings of words
from the English language. The main code is in lib/main.dart.
Below is a screenshot of the app on a virtual Android Machine:

## Who Did What?

I followed this tutorial on my own.

## What you learned

### What worked
* Although Dart is a new language to me, it is very similar to Java/JavaScript (both of which
I have used before) so the learning curve wasn't too steep
* The tutorial I followed did an excellent job breaking down the purpose of the main App component /
 the respective widgets, and I feel like it would be easy to replicate with other functionality.

### What didn't work
* The installation for this SDK was a little bumpy and took longer than anticipated. After reading
some Stack Overflow/Reddit posts, I learned that Windows users  often have issues with this SDK.
This should be kept in mind for anyone considering to use Flutter!
* I wish I allocated more time to play around with my own features.

I followed [this](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt1#0)
tutorial to build this app, which includes all the source code. Time permitting, I would like to
play with it some more and add my own features.
